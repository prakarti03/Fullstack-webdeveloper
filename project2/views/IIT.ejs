    <p style="font-size: 25px;">Before you really begin this book, let me first tell you what this book is not. It is not a guide on how to live through college. On the contrary, it is probably an example of how screwed up your college years can get if you don’t think straight. But then this is my take on it, you’re free to agree or disagree.The intense academic environment at IIT and its psychological effects on students.
    The bond among the three protagonists and how they support each other through difficulties.
    The struggle between following societal expectations and pursuing personal passions.
    The complexities of young love amidst academic pressures.</p>
    <h4 style="font-size: 30px;font-style:unset;">MY NOTES</h4>
